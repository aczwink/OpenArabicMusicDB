  The word is definitely Turkish and means double-stringed and refers to a folk dance.
  However, I didn't find any Turkish source that mentions this rhythm (probably because its folk and not classical).
  The rhythm is also very popular in middle eastern and Balkan music.
  In Arabic music it is often used to accompany taqasim.

  <score type="rhythm2">
  \time 8/4
  \dom \tal \ta \sep r8 \tal \tak \sep \dom \dom \sep \tak r4
  </score>
  The rhythm is also often played a bit faster and can also be considered a 8/8. When orienting to Arabic music its usually used in slow taqasim and is thus written as a 8/4 here.
