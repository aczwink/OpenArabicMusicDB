  This beat is often mistakenly confused with the [[قتاقفتي]] rhythm. They drastically differ in structure.
  Traditionally it is played like this on the طبل:
  <score type="rhythm">
  \time 4/4
  r8 \do r8 \ta \sep
  \do r8 \ta_dot \ti
  </score>

  More modernly, it is played in the following style following the same progression as [[مقسوم]] and its related rhythms:

  <score type="rhythm">
  \time 4/4
  \ta_noBeam \do r8 \ta \sep
  \do r8 \ta r8
  </score>

  == Ornamentation ==
  Modern version inspired by [[صعيدي]]:
  <score type="rhythm">
  \time 4/4
  \ta_noBeam \do r8 \do \sep
  \do r8 \ta r8
  </score>
