  In Arabic often the Turkish names are used but pronounced with Arabic letters.
  In Arabic music this rhythm is most often used a bit faster - thus written as 6/8 here. It can also appear as 6/4.

  == Ornamentation ==

  Erlanger and Faisal Zedan show an older variant of this rhythm with two Dums at the beginning.
  The resulting rhythm is called سَنكين سماعي. It is usually conceived a slower rhythm and is thus written most of the times as 6/4.
