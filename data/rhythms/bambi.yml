  A rather rare Egyptian folk rhythm.
  Though hard to recognise, it is played in the original recording of جفنه علم الغزل by محمد عبد الوهاب.

  <score type="rhythm">
  \time 8/8

  \do r16 \ta r16 \ta \sep
  r8 r8 \do r8
  </score>
  Often the rhythm is started on beat 7.

  == Ornamentation ==

  The most popular variation is the following:
  <score type="rhythm">
  \time 8/8

  \do r16 \ta r16 \ta \sep
  r8 r8 \do \do
  </score>
  It is even more used than the actual rhythm. The form with two dums is sometimes called بمبي كبير and with 3 dums its called بمبي صغير because with two dums the rhythm feels more relaxed. However, this could also be referring to the speed thus whether it is played as 8/8 or 8/4.

  Another variation is by placing an extra accentuated tak usually also with the extra dum like this:
  <score type="rhythm">
  \time 8/8

  \do r16 \ta r16 \ta \sep
  r16 \ta r16 \do \do
  </score>
