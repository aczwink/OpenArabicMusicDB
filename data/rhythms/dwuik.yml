  Pronunciation in Arabic: دْوِيكْ

  Its hard to differ this rhythm from [[مقسوم]] nowadays. One difference is that in دويك the taks are usually played with the weak hand, while in مقسوم these are stronger accentuated and therefore often played as slaps. However, when ornamenting or filling دويك, players usually just play مقسوم no matter whether they are from Arabic countries or Turkey.
  مقسوم is a modern rhythm (from the 20th century) and is used in belly-dancing, folk and popular music while دويك is older and for instance in Turkish music present in classical pieces. For instance Erlanger and Yekta both mention دويك but not مقسوم, which wasn't even existing at these times.
  مقسوم has a faster or more lively feeling than دويك but this does not necessarily affect the speed - though دويك is usually played slower.

  The name comes from the two Persian words دو which means two and يك which means one.
