  This rhythm is usually considered 4/4 but there also exists a 2/4 version. Sometimes the 2/4 is called هجع صغير, while the 4/4 is called هجع كبير respectively.
  However, the 2/4 version exists already under the name [[وحدة سائرة]], thus هجع should be the preferred name for the 4/4 version

  # In [[ألف ليلة وليلة]] the composer logically extended the rhythm to 6/4 in a way, that it matches the feel of the rhythm. It looks like this:
