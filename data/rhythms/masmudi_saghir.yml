  === بلدي ===
  A very popular variation of this rhythm is called بلدي.
  Most people say that this is just an alternative name for مصمودي صغير or a term for folk rhythms.
  I see it as a very popular variation of مصمودي صغير as shown in the rhythm definition below.
  My decision is based on the fact that whenever I asked an Arabic percussion player to play بلدي, he will play exactly this variation.
  Often the 16th notes pairs are rolled, and the 8th taks are played as slaps.
