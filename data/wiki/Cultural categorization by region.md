The Middle East (الشرق الأوسط) consists of three major cultures:
* Arabic

These cultures share many similarities such as the religion and music, however their language is different.

* The East (المشرق), which consists of
** Arabian Peninsula (or Persian Gulf area), with the countries: Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain
