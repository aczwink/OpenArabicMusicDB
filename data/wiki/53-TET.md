53 equal temperament separates the octave into 53 steps of equal size.

The major second is in this tuning equal to 9 steps. The minor is either 4 or 5 dependent on what to approximate.

== Turkish music ==
This tuning system is prevalently used in Turkish music.
The turks call the step misleadingly "comma". This shouldn't be confused with a syntonic or pythagorean comma. The Turkish comma is simply the name for the smallest interval in the tuning system which has the frequency ratio <math>\sqrt[53]{2}</math> (this approximates the syntonic comma however).
53-TET is considered to be a good approximation of the Pythagorean tuning from which Turkish music is derived.
The natural half steps (E-F and B-C) are chosen to be 4 commas (thus approximating the pythagorean Limma). This yields 5 commas for the big halftone (approximating the pythagorean Apotome).

The following figure shows the accidentals used in sheet music and their intervals in the 53-TET system according to Turkish music.
