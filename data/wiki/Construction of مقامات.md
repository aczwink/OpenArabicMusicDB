A مقام is in general formed by joining two أجناس together.
The lower one is called جنس الأصل or simply جنس الأدنى and lies always on the tonic.
The second one is called جنس الفرع or simply جنس الأعلى and lies always on the dominant (غماز).
Because the dominant can be the fifth, the fourth and (rarely) the third, there are three patterns on how a مقام is constructed.

== The منفصل pattern ==
In case the dominant is the fifth, then the مقام is constructed with the منفصل pattern.
In this case there is an interval between the two أجناس which is called بعد فاصل.

Example:

== The مّتصل pattern ==
This pattern matches for every مقام, which has the dominant on the fourth, or the third and is not in فصلة صبا.
In case the dominant is the fourth or the third except for, then the مقام is constructed with the مّتصل pattern. In this case there is an additional interval (a second) after the second جنس called بعد مكّمل.

Example:

== The متدخل pattern ==
This pattern actually only exists for مقامات in فصلة صبا.
The dominant is the third there but the أجناس are overlapping instead of being connected (like in مّتصل pattern). In this case there is an additional interval (a third) after the second جنس called بعدين مكّملين.

Example:

== مراكز ==
There are other predominant notes other than the tonic, octave or dominant which are called مركز (pl. مراكز).
Important secondary أجناس, that are used for modulation, lie on the مراكز.
The measure of importance is difficult because it can be very subjective in تقاسيم.
However, some secondary أجناس are commonly branched to from common مراكز in several مقامات.
These are considered predominant and important and are therefore listed.
For instance صبا has a عجم tetrachord on its sixth note (B-flat when based on D) because it is very commonly used in modulation.

== Mnemonic ==
There is a simple Arabic mnemonic for memorizing the فصائل المقامات. The mnemonic is: صنع بسحرك
* ص stands for صبا
* ن stands for نهاوند
* ع stands for عجم
* ب stands for بياتي
* س stands for Segah
* ح stands for حجاز
* ر stands for Rast
* ك stands for كردي
