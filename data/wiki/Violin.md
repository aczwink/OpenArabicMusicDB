The Violin was adopted into Arabic music during the second half of the 19th century and totally replaced other kind of fiddle instruments.

Typically for Arabic music the Violin is tuned G3, D4, G4, D5.
The drawback of the common GDAE-tuning is that the most-frequent quarter tones in Arabic music E-Half-flat and B-Half-flat are difficult to intonate in first position because the fourth finger has to be used.
The range of the Violin with GDAE-tuning is G3 to roughly E7, and therefore should be D7 with the Arabic tuning.
However, the highest note may be even higher than just stated, which depends of course on the instrument and skill of the player.
The pitch [[Name_origins#Yagah|Yagah]] is the lowest note on the Violin, so usually a G3.

A normal trill but ending with a single descending Turn.
