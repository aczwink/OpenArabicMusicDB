The عود is the most important Arabic instrument and is thus called ملكة الآلات الموسيقية.
The most common traditional Arabic tuning is F2, A2, D3, G3, C4.
Nowadays Ouds also have either a low C2 string or a high F4 string.
So the typical Arabic tuning for Ouds built nowadays is: C2, F2, A2, D3, G3, C4, F4 that gives the Oud a range of C2 to F5 <span style="color:white; background:red">(TODO: higher should be possible)</span>.
The pitch [[Name_origins#Yagah|Yagah]] on the Oud is one whole step higher than the lowest note on the traditional tuning, thus usually a G2.

Most sheet music for Oud is written in G-Clef but is then played one octave lower, in fact it is played as if written in suboctave G-Clef (exactly like guitar or bass).

Syrian ouds usually have a scale length (length of the resonating part of the strings) of 60 cm, while Turkish ones usually have 58.5 cm.
