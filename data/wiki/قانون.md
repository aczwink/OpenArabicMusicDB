The Arabic قانون has 26 string courses with each course consisting of 3 strings tuned to unison.
The very low or very high courses may have less than 3 strings.
The strings are tuned in general: C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb with one exception being the lowest string, which is usually tuned to G2.
The قانون has tuning levers (see figure downwards), called <span style="color:white; background:red">TODO: 3oraaab?</span>, for each course that allow small pitch variations that are used to set up مقامات. The range that can be adjusted using the levers is usually a tone.
Modern standard Arabic قاوانين have 4 levers, where each adds a quarter tone to the strings pitch.
Therefore the following adjustments can be made: + quarter tone, + half tone, + 3/4 tone, + tone.
Some قاوانين have on the string courses C, Db, Gb and Ab also a fifth lever below the other 4 that adds 1/6 of a tone <span style="color:white; background:red">TODO: ist das richtig? gemessen wurde n viertel temperierter halbton (also häflte vom quarter tone. also eigentlich 1/8)</span>.
The very low and very high string courses usually don’t have the full levers set.
The lowest string usually has no lever at all, which is why it is tuned to G instead of Gb.
As said before the lowest string is tuned to G2, and usually the highest string has only one lever, that adds a half tone, thus the highest playable pitch is D6 giving the قانون a total of 3.5 octaves.
However, it should be noted that the player can increase the pitch additionally by pressing the nail of his left hands’ thumb on the string and thus shortening it.
The pitch [[Name_origins#Yagah|Yagah]] is exactly one octave above the lowest note, so usually a G3<ref>S.L. Marcus. Arab music theory in the modern period. University of California, Los Angeles, 1989</ref>.

=== Information for players/builders ===
Care is needed when applying the strings on the pegs.
Normally for other string instruments the string should be put close to the wood, so that the friction with the string additionally prevents the string from moving and therefore going out of tune.
For the قانون it is exactly the opposite.
The peg should be placed quite upwards around the peg.
The tension will force the peg to be pulled down by the string and it will therefore hold stronger.
If the string is too far down around the peg, the opposite will happen.
The more the string it tightened, the more it will wrap at the bottom and therefore pull the peg out of the hole.
This will obviously lead to instability of the peg and the tuning will change more easily.
In the following figure one can see the correct and wrong placement of the string around the peg.
