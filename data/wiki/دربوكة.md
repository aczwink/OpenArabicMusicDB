== Modern Egyptian model ==
The probably most well known model is the Egyptian model that is made of casted metal and has a plastic drum head.

This model has been widely adopted and is also produced in Turkey, among other countries. There it is often called "oriental Darbuka" to distinguish it from the Turkish Darbuka. Turkish "oriental" darbukas usually have 8 bolts instead of 6 and the size of the head is slightly different.
Drum heads usually have a total height of 15 mm, although the Turkish and Egyptian models differ in height of the metal collar and skin.
Egyptian Darbukas require a head with 8 mm in height for the skin and 7 mm for the collar.
The skin height for a Turkish oriental Darbuka is 10 mm, while the collar is 5 mm in height.
Attaching an Egyptian drum head on a Turkish oriental Darbuka will make it sound extremely sharp if it even fits at all.
