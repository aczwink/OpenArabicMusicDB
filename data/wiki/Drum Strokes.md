# Primary strokes
* Dom - Bass tone
The bass tone, called "Dom" or Dum" is produced with the dominant hand, with the tip of the middle finger reaching the center of the drum. In sheet music, it is written here always with the stem going downwards. Careful, many do the opposite!

* Tak - Treble tone
The main treble tone that is produced by stroking the rim of the drum with the dominant hand. This has a upwards stem in score notation.

* Weak-hand Tak
Same as Tak but produced with the weak hand. Weak-hand score is, if included, written on an extra (lower) line. The dominant hand line is always included, either as a single line, or the upper one if used in combination with a weak-hand line.
Also wrongly called “Ka“ by many drummers / methods, which occurred because a Tak followed by a Weak-hand Tak is spoken in Arabic rhythmic language "Ta-ka" instead of "Tak Tak".

# Additional strokes

## Finger roll
The weak hand is used to create a fast finger roll before the actual stroke.
This technique is called ربط or قرشي.
