The traditional Arabic pitch name system contains 48 relative pitches each having a unique name. Thus there is no repetition at the octave. The system is not fixed pitched as western scientific pitch notation but relative. So each instrument resembles these sounds differently. For instance on the Violin the pitch [[Name origins#Yagah|Yagah]] would be the G3, the lowest string. However, suppose the Violin is tuned a whole step down, then that pitch is F3 but it would still be called [[Name origins#Yagah|Yagah]].
The following two tables list the note names. The pitch rise from top to bottom, so lowest pitch is at the top.

Arabic sheet music is usually written in G-Clef. Therefore Arabic pitch names in relation with a score, are given for the Violin. In other words, in a score the pitch [[Name origins#Yagah|Yagah]] is G3 and all others are relative to that.
