This wiki is based on the following resources, ordered by importance (top is most important):
* The author, Amir Czwink, was introduced to Arabic rhythm (إيقاع) by فرحان صباغ who is a master of عود and Arabic percussion. He is the primary source for OpenArabicMusicDB. Over his life he gathered around 100 rhythms which he noted himself into a private notebook. Unfortunately there is no further information (like rhythmic structure, where the rhythm is played etc.) on the rhythms than their names and the rhythm itself. Also, because this is a collection by practical experience, some names are questionable, as he got the information from other musicians or locals. And like many collections it has the purpose of accumulating all ever heard rhythms and therefore lacks structure.

* The French musicologist Rodolphe D’Erlanger that specialized in Arabic music, released in the early 20th century a series of 6 books on Arabic music. He held good contact with Arabic music scientists like the Syrian Ali Darwish for instance. His work is the major contribution for conserving the “old“ Arabic music. The 6th band (La Musique arabe Tome sixième: Essai de codification des règles usuelles de la musique arabe moderne, le système rythmique, les diverses formes de composition artistique. Geuthner, 1959.) covers 111 rhythms - a huge collection of rhythms that were forgotten over time.

* The Arabic book (الموسيقى النظرية) by سليم الحلو is a well accepted book about Arabic music theory. The author is known to be an enthusiastic collector of موشحات. While its’ amount of information is great, at least for the rhythms, there is heavy Turkish influence in his writings. However, the amount of different rhythms that he lists is great and many of them couldn’t be found elsewhere.

* The book "Die Musik der Araber" by Habib Hassan Touma is a great resource for getting a broad coarse view on Arabic music for non-Arabic readers. While the author does not go deep into details, he gives a list of some rhythms and gives information about rhythmic structure.

* A great master of Arabic rhythm and teacher is Faisal Zedan. He originally comes from Syria/Lebanon. Many information was collected based on his teachings. According to him, all meters above or equal to 11 counts are combined meters. They are a concatenation of smaller parts. Parts with 2, 3 or 4 counts are called joints (مفصل). Parts with 5 or 6 counts are called bridges (جسر). An 8 count part is called tie (ربطة).

* The learning web site www.maqamworld.com is a collection of Arabic tonal scales and also some rhythms. The sources of their rhythms is based on analysis of recordings.

* The Syrian artist Mohamed Alsiadi collects Arabic tonal scales and rhythms and offers them freely on his websites.

== Turkish Music ==

When studying Arabic rhythms, you compulsorily come across Turkish rhythms. Their influence on the Arabic music (and vice versa) is ubiquitously present and noticeable. Therefore it is not possible to look at Arabic rhythms exclusively. This is why OpenArabicMusicDB also includes information about Turkish percussion methodology.
The following sources were considered for that matter (the same ordering as for the other sources):
* Raouf Yekta Bey is one of the major Turkish music theorists of the 20th century. The modern music theory of the Turks is heavily based on his work "La musique turque" Librairie Delagrave, 1922, which describes Turkish music theory while using western notation. In addition the author wrote it in French, which made the work unique at that time. Yekta is highly appreciated in Turkey among music scientists and performers.

* The Turkish website eked.org.tr lists a lot of Turkish rhythms with much information for each. Unfortunately the website is Turkish only.

* Another good website is www.turksanatmuzigi.org/usullerimiz. For each rhythm, videos are included, showing it being played on 3 different instruments. On the first instrument the rhythm is shown as written and for the other two it is heavily varied. The variation rules of Turkish rhythms in Turkish music could not entirely be decoded. Either these are common variations to the rhythm or on the shown instrument always this variation is played? This is unclear...
