# Persian ordinal names

## Yagah
According to <ref>Wiktionary, the free dictionary, 2017 https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/گاه Accessed on 2017</ref>, گاه as a noun means “place“ or “time“; while it is also used as a suffix forming words of location. The word یک means “one“. Therefore the word یکگاه means something like “first place“ or “first location“. In <ref>S.L. Marcus. Arab music theory in the modern period. University of California, Los Angeles, 1989 p. 74</ref> it is translated as “first position“ which is a translation with a better musical sense.
Because of the lack of the persian letter گ, in Arabic the word is written and pronounced يكاه.

## Dukah
دوگاه means “second position“ (see above). The word is written and pronounced دوكاه and sometimes the و is spoken “o“.

## Segah
سه گاه means “third position“ (see above). The word is written and pronounced سِكاه or سيكاه.
