In this section the known roots of Names are listed that are used in Arabic music. This includes also words written in Arabic that do not originate in its language.

== Persian ordinal names ==

=== Yagah ===
According to <ref>Wiktionary, the free dictionary, 2017 https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/گاه Accessed on 2017</ref>, گاه as a noun means “place“ or “time“; while it is also used as a suffix forming words of location. The word یک means “one“. Therefore the word یکگاه means something like “first place“ or “first location“. In <ref>S.L. Marcus. Arab music theory in the modern period. University of California, Los Angeles, 1989 p. 74</ref> it is translated as “first position“ which is a translation with a better musical sense.
Because of the lack of the persian letter گ, in Arabic the word is written and pronounced يكاه.

=== Dukah ===
دوگاه means “second position“ (see above). The word is written and pronounced دوكاه and sometimes the و is spoken “o“.

=== Segah ===
سه گاه means “third position“ (see above). The word is written and pronounced سِكاه or سيكاه.


== Other derivations of Persian language ==

=== Rast ===
The Farsi word راست means straight, right, direct, correct, true, honest.
In Arabic the word is usually written exactly as in Farsi but is usually pronounced رصد.

=== سوزناك ===
سوزنک appears to be a Farsi word. There is also a village in Iran that is called like that.
Arabic musicians additionally pronounce the Alif, thus the writing سوزناك.


== Persian names ==

=== شهناز ===
شَهناز is a Farsi female name and means “Pride of a King".
In Arabic this name is written exactly the same as in Farsi and is pronounced as written.

=== نهاوند ===
The word نَهاوَند is the name of one of the oldest Persian cities.
In Arabic the word is written exactly the same as in Farsi. It is pronounced exactly as written (in Arabic).


== Other names ==

=== بياتي ===
The Bayat originally was a Turkic clan or tribe that settled in Turkmenistan, Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan and the surrounding area. It is also a common surname in the just mentioned area. Bayat is also a Turkish word, which means stale.
In Arabic, the tribe is written بيات and that name is used in the senses of مقام البيات, referring to the tribe, and مقام البياتي, meaning the Bayat-ish Maqam. So both terms are used, there is no standard in Arabic music teaching.

=== كردي ===
Obviously this is the Arabic word for "Kurdish". This name is also used as مقام الكرد and مقام الكردي, exactly as بياتي.
