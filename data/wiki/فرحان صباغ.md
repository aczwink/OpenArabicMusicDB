</score>

=== 8 ===

==== بلدي ====
Master Sabbagh insists that this rhythm is different from [[مصمودي صغير]] but also sees the definition of [[مصمودي صغير#بلدي|بلدي]] as a variation already.
He agrees that his definition could be seen as a variation of [[مصمودي كبير]] (because of the 8 beats), however for him it is very important that there is a stroke on each beat, which makes the rhythm unique.
<score type="rhythm">
\time 8/4
\dom \dom \tak \tak \dom \tak \tak r4

<score type="rhythm">

==== أقصاق ====
Apparently some variation of [[أقصاق]] starting on beat 3.
<score type="rhythm">
\time 9/8
\ta \ta \sep \do_noBeam r8 \sep \do r8 \ta \sep \do_noBeam r8
</score>

=== 10 ===

==== سماعي ثقيل ====
Master Sabbagh defines the rhythm like this, which is not in line with the Arabic literature (see [[سماعي ثقيل]]):
<score type="rhythm">
\time 10/8
\do r8 \ta \ta r \do \do \ta r \ta
</score>
However, this can simply be seen as a variation as the two additional strokes have less emphasis than the other two taks.
