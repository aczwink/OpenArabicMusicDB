  The main Maqam in its family.
  In Turkish it is called Uşşâk (عشّاق).
  
  Another very related Maqam is حُسيني. Some say it differs because it makes use of the quarter-tone on the 6th degree (which بياتي does not according to them). Others say its different because it has a different tonal emphasis and development.
  
  The most popular Arabic maqam according to Anwar Hariri.
